This is Dublin bikes web application that display the current available dublin bikes in the map, along with future availability based on our machine learning model.
As part of our Software Engineering module in UCD, we were giving the task to develop a whole scale web application to do with Dublin bikes.

The web application is deployed on AWS EC2, Address of the live website: http://ec2-3-80-156-155.compute-1.amazonaws.com:90/

## What the project does

<b>The aim of this project is to build a Dublin bikes web application that provides all the necessary information to the users of Dublin
bikes in Ireland.</b> The popularity of Dublin city Bikes has increased rapidly over the past two decades. As many company
and multinational company are encouraging employees to avoid CO2 emissions and take alternatives
people are moving towards healthier commuting to work such as Dublin bikes. 

Furthermore, as there is not a good product in the market to provide this service, we
decided to step forward to deliver the product the user deserves. Extra features and services that is not
provided by other websites are predictions of future available bikes, weather etc.
